# Bird Lab R Template

This is a collection of scripts (or will be; currently just one script) to
streamline working with R for our lab. It includes a number of examples of
commonly used error checks and figures.


## Download

Here are two ways to download the example scripts and data:

1) You can download this repository directly from GitHub by going to the
[NRRI Bird Lab repo](https://github.com/ngwalton/nrri-bird-lab) and clicking
"Clone or download" then "Download ZIP". You can then unzip the file where ever
you like and start using it.

2) If you already have [RStuio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and
[GitHub](https://desktop.github.com/) installed, you can download the examples
and data from RStudio.
Open RStudio and choose File > New project > Version Control > Git.
In the URL box paste https://github.com/ngwalton/nrri-bird-lab.git.
Choose the location where you want to save the NRRI Bird Lab template and click
"Create Project". The examples and data will be saved and you'll be able to
use "pull" in RStudio to get the latest version when updates are released.
